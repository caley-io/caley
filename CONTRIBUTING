### Contributing
First off, thanks for your interest in contributing to Caley Email. We hope this is a safe and fun space to learn and help build an incredible tool.

## Vision
At Caley, we're focused on building software that is useful, intuitive, and intelligent. Caley Email is a strong attempt at doing just that. 
This means that we expect issues and pull requests to be thoughtful in design, and great places to discuss and push hard into technical discussions
and ideas. Please lead with respect as you interact with members of this community.

## Contributing well
1. Start with forking the repository! You can create a pull request off of your fork to interact with the repository. 
2. When interested in working on an issue, please read through the description and comments carefully. If the issue hasn't been claimed, add a comment
stating that you will take the issue on and claim it for yourself! 
3. If an issue has been claimed, but development seems to have gone stale, feel free to comment and start working on it. We can find a way to clear up the state
and potentially get your code moved forward. 
4. When your code is ready and CI has passed, add the 'review' label to your PR so we know to take a look.
5. We'll approach reviews with respect and we ask that you do the same!
